This is my personal portfolio website. a digital corner where I pretend to have my life together.  
It's built to showcase the projects I have finished or am working on, and a bit of who I am (still figuring that out).

##  Tech Stack

- **React JS** 
- **TailwindCSS** 
- **Netlify** because I'm a broke college student

---

##  Features

- Required Details: `About Me`, `Projects`, `Education`, `Contact`, `Blog`
- Dark mode because I'm not a sociopath
- Easter eggs? Maybe.

##  Disclaimer

If anything looks broken, it's probably a feature.  
If anything looks cool, I definitely meant to do that.
